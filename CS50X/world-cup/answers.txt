Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations (for example: 10 or 100 simulations), the top teams that included in the ranking receive a much higher percentage, while other teams didn't printed on the rankings.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about thousand(1000) simulations. By increasing more than 1000 simulations, the running time of the program also increases while getting same results as 1000 simulations.
