sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: I takes longer in random and reversed list but its the fastest in sorted list.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: It is the fastest of all of the algorithms especially on random list.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: The time gap on each list are very close which makes sense because it uses O(n^2) on all of them.



//random
Sort 1 = 0m6.708s
Sort 2 = 0m0.429s
Sort 3 = 0m2.351s

//reversed
Sort 1 = 0m5.047s
Sort 2 = 0m0.436s
Sort 3 = 0m2.515s

//sorted
Sort 1 = 0m0.514s
Sort 2 = 0m0.567s
Sort 3 = 0m2.343s
